Also, the command can only be executed in the how to appeal text channel under the support category. The command starts by the user typing `/appeal_ban <type>` where type is either mute, kick, or ban. Warnings are not logged to the database, so therefore are not searchable. THe user then receives a paginator embed showing each log and its details, one log per embed page. Afterwards, the user can select which number log they want to appeal, and given that they meet the requirements (go to the channel), then they can appeal the ban. Once the selection has been made, a preset channel under the Appeals category (under construction) will then alert the user that the channel has been appended to them, if a channel is avaialable. If not, they'll go into a que (future updates). If the decision is made to allow the appeal, then the record is deleted from the database, or `stricken from the record`"
